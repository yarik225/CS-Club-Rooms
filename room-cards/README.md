# SHS CS Club Website Room Cards
This is an implementation of the cards that show room information on the SHS Computer Science club website.

Made By: Tyler Yeh

## JavaScript Utilities
The [room-cards.js](room-cards.js) file contains code for creating E-Board member objects and displaying clubs with their information on the website. You can review the commends I wrote for the classes and their methods.

## Confusing Terminology
When I was writing the code, I accidentally referred to all the rooms as "clubs", this may be confusing. I might have also messed up "E-Board". If someone could change this in the future, that would be great.

## Demo
Try the [demo.html](demo.html) to add your own information to the room cards and to see the design.
